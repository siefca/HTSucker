# HTSucker is a class that provides an easy way of obtaining documents from the web.
# It follows redirects and allows you to set up various connection parameters like
# size limits and timeouts.
# 
# It is intended to be used in programs getting some information about web pages
# and processing resources that aren’t too big, since it keeps all data in memory.
# 
# HTSucker tries to figure out content's language using server headers, HTML tags,
# code markers, and if fails it then uses top-level domain name to spoken
# language mapping. It doesn't use any XML object model to access (X)HTML tags
# but relies on regular expressions.
# 
# All operations are lazy, which means that after creating an object you will
# still be able to change some connection parameters. Real data fetching will occur
# while accessing body, headers or other data that requires network access. This class
# uses net/http module.
